                <strong>Is my order shipped? Where can I check on the status of my order?</strong>
                <br />
                We will notify you by email once your order have been shipped, and if you received a tracking number you can follow your parcel at: https://www.chronopost.fr/en/private/track-your-parcel

                <strong>I haven't received my items yet, what do I do?</strong>
                <br />
                The best thing to do is to make sure you order with a tracking number so that you can keep up to date with the delivery status. If there are any issues or delays once the products are shipped, you will need to take it up with the carrier yourself. If the order has not been shipped within 7 of ordering, please contact us at letierce.lo@gmail.com for more information.
